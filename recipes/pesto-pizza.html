    <h1>Pesto Pizza</h1>

    <h4>A great alternative to your regular pizza.</h4>
    <p>
        To me, a good pesto pizza should have bold pesto flavor. 
        I don’t want it to taste faintly of basil, garlic, 
        Parmesan and olive oil—I want those flavors to bowl me over. 
        The key is to spread a generous layer of pesto over the pizzas 
        before baking, and then top them with more pesto when they come 
        out of the oven. Not only do these pizzas taste very “pesto-y,” 
        they also look gorgeous and feel a little more special than your 
        typical pizza pie.

        I’ve given instructions for homemade pizza dough below but don’t 
        feel obligated to make it; store-bought pizza dough works beautifully and makes 
        this recipe totally doable on a weeknight. Same goes for the pesto — if you 
        want to make it from scratch, use this recipe, but store-bought works well, too 
        (I like Mama’s pesto from Whole Foods).
