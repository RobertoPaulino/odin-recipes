    <p>
        Deviled eggs (also known as stuffed eggs, Russian eggs, or dressed eggs) 
        are hard-boiled eggs that have been shelled, cut in half, and filled with 
        a paste made from the egg yolks mixed with other ingredients such as mayonnaise 
        and mustard. They are generally served cold as a side dish, appetizer or a main course during 
        gatherings or parties. The dish's origin can be seen in recipes for boiled, seasoned eggs as far back as ancient Rome, 
        where they were traditionally served as a first course. The dish is popular in Europe and in North America.
